> To be stronger.

My name is Lester Tan. I am a college student majored in Computer Science. But my research field have not been determined yet. I don't have a wide range of hobbies. Watching anime might be the only one. At my leisure, I always indulge in [bilibili](<https://space.bilibili.com/3434934>), that is a video website. Now I'm trying to learn Japanese by myself, but I seems to lack perseverance.

I'm going to put on the blog all kinds of stuff about daily life, study notes, learning materials or something.
